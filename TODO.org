* TODO the unit interval across which colors are spread out should be a parameter to `go`, and part of the filename.
* TODO Compare exponential and polynomial velocity curves.
  See the functions `polynomial` and `expRange` in `Touch.hs`.
* TODO Specify black keys as notes, not keys.
* TODO Do I need the LumaTouchConfig parameter?

  thinking it was the parameter that defines velocity,
  and I lost whatever the original value was.
  That happened slightly before (on the same day as) commit
