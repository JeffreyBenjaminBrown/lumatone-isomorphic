Algorithm: First calculate a fully color-saturated chain of fifths with hue value spaced equally in [0,360), such that one more step would go to 360. Then color a vertical few at the octave white, and a vertical few at the half-octave black. This might work for every edo.
```
import Data.Colour.SRGB (RGB())
import Data.Colour.RGBSpace.HSL (hsl)

H.hsl 0 1 0.5   -- (1,0,0)
H.hsl 120 1 0.5 -- (0,1,0)
H.hsl 240 1 0.5 -- (0,0,1)
```
